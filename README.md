# myo-training

This repository contains code on how to train a gesture classifier for three simple gesture
classes: right-wave, left-wave and everything else.

The notebook produces a k-nearest neighbours and a decision tree model.

For input, you'll need to train your own Myo data, see
[Data_Capture.py](https://github.com/Jegp/myo/blob/master/scripts/Data_Capture.py) in my [myo
repository](https://github.com/Jegp/myo).
